# Naming Conventions

## Context

- This rule applies to all TypeScript and TSX files in the project
- Clear naming improves code readability and self-documentation

## Requirements

- Always use descriptive variable names that explain their purpose
- Always use auxiliary verbs for boolean variables and state (isLoading, hasError)
- Always use present tense for functions that perform actions (fetchData, validateInput)
- Always use noun phrases for data variables (userData, configOptions)
- Always use camelCase for variables and functions
- Always use PascalCase for types, interfaces, and components
