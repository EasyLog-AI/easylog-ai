# nuqs URL State Management

## Context

Our application uses the 'nuqs' library to manage state through URL search parameters, making state shareable and bookmarkable.

## Requirements

- Use 'nuqs' hooks for any state that should be preserved in the URL
- Prefer URL state over local state for filters, pagination, and view preferences
- Use appropriate parsers and serializers for different data types
- Ensure URL parameters have meaningful, descriptive names
- Handle default values appropriately
