# Prompt Engineering Guide for LLMs

## Prompt Formats

### Direct Prompts (Zero-shot)

Providing the model with a direct instruction or question without additional context or examples.

```
Generate 5 ideas for reducing carbon emissions in urban areas.
```

### One-shot, Few-shot, and Multi-shot Prompts

Providing the model with one or more examples of desired input-output pairs before presenting the actual prompt.

```
Example 1:
Input: Summarize this article about climate change.
Output: This article discusses the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and extreme weather events, and outlines potential mitigation strategies.

Now, summarize this article about artificial intelligence: [article text]
```

### Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompts

Encouraging the model to break down complex reasoning into intermediate steps.

```
Question: If I buy 3 books at $12 each and 2 magazines at $5 each, how much will I spend in total?
Let's think step by step:
```

### Zero-shot CoT Prompts

Combining chain of thought with zero-shot by asking the model to perform reasoning steps.

```
Solve this problem step by step: A train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then at 30 mph for 3 hours. What is the average speed for the entire journey?
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Clear Context**: Include relevant information that helps the model understand the task.

2. **Be Specific**: Clear instructions yield better results than vague ones.

   ```
   Good: "Write a 150-word email to schedule a business meeting with a client for next Tuesday at 2pm."
   Less effective: "Write a business email."
   ```

3. **Use Structured Formats**: Format prompts with clear sections for context, examples, and instructions.

   ```
   CONTEXT: You are a financial advisor helping clients understand investment options.
   TASK: Explain the difference between stocks and bonds to a beginning investor.
   TONE: Conversational and easy to understand without financial jargon.
   ```

4. **Include Examples**: Demonstrate the desired output format or style.

5. **Specify Output Format**: Clearly state how you want the response formatted.

   ```
   Provide your answer as a bulleted list with 3-5 points.
   ```

6. **Use Role Prompting**: Assign a specific role to guide the model's perspective.

   ```
   You are an experienced cybersecurity professional. Explain how to create a strong password policy for a mid-sized company.
   ```

7. **Control Response Length**: Guide the model on how detailed the response should be.

   ```
   Explain quantum computing in approximately 100 words.
   ```

8. **Iterative Refinement**: Modify prompts based on previous outputs to improve results.

## Advanced Techniques

1. **System Prompts**: Setting the behavior and capabilities of the AI system.

2. **Evaluation Criteria**: Including self-evaluation instructions in the prompt.

   ```
   After generating your answer, evaluate it based on accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
   ```

3. **In-context Learning**: Providing relevant examples and guidance within the prompt.

4. **Prompt Chaining**: Breaking complex tasks into a series of simpler prompts.

5. **Temperature Control**: Adjusting creativity vs. determinism (usually set externally but can be requested in prompt).
   ```
   Generate a creative and unique story. Feel free to be imaginative.
   ```
   vs.
   ```
   Provide a factual, accurate summary of the historical event without embellishment.
   ```
