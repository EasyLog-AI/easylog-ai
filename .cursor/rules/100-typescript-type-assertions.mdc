# TypeScript Type Assertions Standards

## Context

- This rule applies to all TypeScript and TSX files in the project
- Type assertions bypass TypeScript's type checking and can lead to runtime errors

## Requirements

- Never use type assertions (as) unless absolutely necessary
- Document any necessary use of type assertions with comments
