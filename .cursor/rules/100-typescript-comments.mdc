description: USE JSDoc-style comments (/** */) instead of single-line comments (//) in all TypeScript files
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx}
---

# TypeScript Comment Formatting

## Context

- This rule applies to all TypeScript and TSX files in the project

## Requirements

- Always use JSDoc-style comments with `/** */` syntax
- Never use single-line comments with `//` syntax
- Multi-line comments should start with `/**` and end with `*/`
- Each line of a multi-line comment should begin with `*`

## Examples

### ✅ Good

```ts
/**
 * - Uploads a file to the storage service
 * - @param file - The file to upload
 * - @returns A promise that resolves when the upload is complete
 */
function uploadFile(file: File): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### ❌ Bad

```ts
// Uploads a file to the storage service
function uploadFile(file: File): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```
