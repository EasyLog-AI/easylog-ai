# Cursor Rules Format

## File Organization

- **Location**: `.cursor/rules/` with `.mdc` extension
- **Naming Convention**: `PREFIX-name.mdc`
  - `000-core.mdc` - Core standards
  - `100-{lang}-*.mdc` - Language specific (js, py, etc.)
  - `200-framework-*.mdc` - Framework specific (react, vue, etc.)
  - `300-testing.mdc` - Testing standards
  - `400-docs.mdc` - Documentation standards
  - `_private-*.mdc` - Private rules

~## Glob Patterns

- Core standards: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- Language rules: `src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- Testing standards: `**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- React components: `src/components/**/*.{tsx,jsx}`
- Documentation: `docs/**/*.md`
- API rules: `api/**/*`

## Required Fields

### Frontmatter

- `description`: ACTION TRIGGER OUTCOME format
- `globs`: glob pattern for files and folders

### Body Requirements

- Context: Usage conditions
- Requirements: Actionable items
- Examples: Both valid and invalid

## Formatting Guidelines

- Always indent content within nested sections by 2 spaces
- Keep rules as short as possible
- Use Mermaid syntax if it will be shorter or clearer than describing a complex rule
- Use Emojis where appropriate to convey meaning that will improve rule understanding by the AI Agent
- Keep examples as short as possible to clearly convey the positive or negative example

## AI Optimization

### Tips

- Use precise, deterministic ACTION TRIGGER OUTCOME format in description
- Provide concise positive and negative example of rule application in practice
- Optimize for AI context window efficiency
- Remove any non-essential or redundant information
- Use standard glob patterns without quotes (e.g., _.js, src/\*\*/_.ts)

### Context Efficiency

- Keep frontmatter description under 120 characters while maintaining clear intent
- Limit examples to essential patterns only
- Use hierarchical structure for quick parsing
- Remove redundant information across sections
- Maintain high information density with minimal tokens
- Focus on machine-actionable instructions over human explanations

## Critical Rules

- The front matter can ONLY have the fields description and globs
- The file MUST start with this exactly:
  ```
  ---
  description: front matter description
  globs: front matter glob pattern or no value
  ---
  ```
- All contents after the frontmatter should be well-structured
- NEVER include verbose explanations or redundant context that increases AI token overhead
- Keep file as short and to the point as possible BUT NEVER at the expense of sacrificing rule impact and usefulness for the AI Agent
