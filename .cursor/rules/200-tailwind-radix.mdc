# Tailwind and Radix Component Guidelines

## Context

Our application uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessible components. We follow a mobile-first approach to responsive design.

## Requirements

- Prefer internal \_ui/\*\* components over direct Radix components when they exist
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling needs
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's mobile-first breakpoint system
- Ensure components are accessible and follow Radix UI best practices
- Avoid inline styles or CSS-in-JS solutions
