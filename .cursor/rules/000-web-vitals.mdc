# Web Vitals Optimization

## Context

Web Vitals are essential metrics for providing a great user experience. We focus on optimizing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and First Input Delay (FID).

## Requirements

- Keep LCP under 2.5 seconds by optimizing image loading and server response times
- Minimize CLS to under 0.1 by setting explicit dimensions for images and dynamic content
- Reduce FID to under 100ms by minimizing main thread blocking
- Implement proper loading strategies (lazy loading, preloading critical assets)
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size with code splitting and tree shaking
