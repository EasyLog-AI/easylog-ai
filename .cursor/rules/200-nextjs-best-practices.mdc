# Next.js Best Practices

## Context

Our application uses Next.js and follows its recommended patterns for data fetching, rendering, and routing to ensure optimal performance and developer experience.

## Requirements

- Use the App Router for all new routes and features
- Implement Server Components by default, using Client Components only when necessary
- Follow recommended data fetching patterns based on use case
- Use appropriate rendering strategies (Static, Dynamic, Streaming) based on content needs
- Implement proper caching and revalidation strategies
- Use route handlers for API endpoints
